This is a basic HTML/CSS page for a FreeCodeCamp project.

The idea behind this is to learn how the various tags and css commands work in  a basic and rudementary way. I don't like the layout, and would love to figure out more things, but I want to limit my time with these projects so I don't fall into a rabbit hole. This stays basic for now, maybe forever. 20.03.2020

I picked Buzz Aldrin as the subject semirandomly.
